The Quiz App was an exercise to build an interactive app from scratch. This task provided the challenge of bringing together all the skills covered in Thinkful's Engineering Flex boot camp up to module eight of twenty-six. There were several user experience, technical, and process requirements to successfully complete the app. Some of the technical requirements included: render answer choices in a form; use semantic HTML, along with CSS and jQuery; follow a11y best practices; use responsive design; and be fully usable by keyboard.
